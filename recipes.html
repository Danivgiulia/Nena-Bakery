                <h3>Chocolate Chip Cookies</h3>
                <p>My grandma's chocolate chip cookies were born out of love for her family. As a young mother during the holidays, she wanted to bake something special for her children. She used what she had on hand: a bag of chocolate pieces her neighbor had gifted her and her trusted pantry staples. Grandma would always say she didn't follow a recipe—she followed her heart. I remember sitting at the kitchen table as she explained how each cookie was made with an extra pinch of sugar "to sweeten the day." The smell of warm cookies filling her tiny kitchen remains a cherished memory.</p>
