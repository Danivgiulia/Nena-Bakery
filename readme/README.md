Grandma's Baking Website 

This project is dedicated to my grandmother, more popularly known in my family as Nena. She has been my role model since I was young and an extraordinary mother figure in my life. She is a reserved person, the only way to get to know her warmth and self-expression is through her cooking and baking. I made this website as a basic layout to keep updating for the rest of my life, filling it with all the recipes her grandmother passed down to her and now to me. 

One of my main goals and inspiration to create this website was for elderly people accessing the website in search for an easy recipe to follow. My own grandmother, from time to time will look up new things to try out and constantly complains of how complicated they make the websites and that its hard to read - you would be able to see her squinting and zooming in from across the room looking all puzzled. 

So as you click on it, you will notice that everything is zoomed in and easy to follow, with the method and ingridients right next to eachother.
