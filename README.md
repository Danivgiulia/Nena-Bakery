# Grandma's Baking Website

This project is dedicated to my grandmother, more popularly known in my family as Nena. She has been my role model since I was young and an extraordinary mother figure in my life. She is a reserved person, the only way to get to know her warmth and self-expression is through her cooking and baking. I made this website as a basic layout to keep updating for the rest of my life, filling it with all the recipes her grandmother passed down to her and now to me.

One of my main goals and inspiration to create this website was for elderly people accessing the website in search for an easy recipe to follow. My own grandmother, from time to time will look up new things to try out and constantly complains of how complicated they make the websites and that its hard to read - you would be able to see her squinting and zooming in from across the room looking all puzzled.

So as you click on it, you will notice that everything is zoomed in and easy to follow, with the method and ingredients right next to eachother.

## Features

### Navigation Bar

The navigation bar, which sits at the top of the page and dissapears once users sroll down, contains three links that takes the users to the recipes page and the what's cooking page. 

On my next update I will most like add a burger icon to hide the navigation panel as so the landing page can appear cleaner. 

### The Landing Page

The landing page features the title of the website infront of a landing page image. Right above it is a navigation bar that hides once you scroll down to the rest of the page.

Directly under the landing page image and title is a 'Featured' Section which shows 'The Most Loved Recipe' which is the chocolate chip cookie recipe. The background image is fixed so that when the user scrolls it catches their attention. Once clicked it takes you directly to the recipe on the Recipes page of the website.

Underneath the featured section is the 'About Us' section which tells the user a little bit of our traditions and family values. It also features a section about Grandma Nena, which shows a video about her life.

### The Footer section

The footer section is a simple section that has links to the instagram and facebook account.

In the next update of the website I would like to modernize and simplify this section to make it more user friendly.

### The Recipes Page

The recipes page, similar to the landing page, a background image and a title showing what the page the user is at.

<br>

The recipes available to choose are made into giant buttons. I did it this way because my main target audience, as specified before, are a more mature audience, like my own grandmother, most struggle with not knowing how to progress on a webpage or how to get where they want to go to.

<br>

On my next update I will probably add a feature that when the users mouse hovers over the links to the recipes it will light up so that it is more user friendly.

To add more of an interesting background I decided to make the background image still of every recipe when you scroll through. I had to make sure to use high resolution images so that when enlarged on any device it wouldn't pixalate and look blurry.

### What's Cooking?

On the next page there is a form that anyone can complete to be part of a chance to cook with Grandma. It's a simple form that in future updates will be more detailed and ask the user perhaps which recipe they would like to try the most.

## Adaptability

The entire webpage is adaptable to any screen size to make it accessible to anyone.

## Testing

W3C Validator - I have tested the code with https://validator.w3.org/ and it passed with no fail

CSS Jigsaw Validator - I have tested the code with https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ and it passed with no fail

## Unfixed Bugs

The only unfixed bug that I haven't had the time to fix was the video link on the landing page under the About Grandma section not working. The actaul video screen will show up however not turn on or show any video available for the user to see.

##Â Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment. The live link can be found here - https://danivgiulia.github.io/Nena-Bakery/

Features to add in the near future

Apart from all the features that I previusly mentioned in each section that I will be wanting to add in the near future I also want to add the following;

I will be adding the images locally so the load time is faster.

## Credits

I did use the insiration and a lot of the instructions on how to build this webpage by following along with the love running website form Code Institute - https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+LRFX101+7/courseware/e805068059af42af87681032aa64053f/1da6ad13213740f1855a51d30a2375b1/ e
