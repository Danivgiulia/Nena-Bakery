                <h2>Family Traditions</h2>

                    <p>In our family, baking isn't just about creating something delicious—it's about creating memories. From the moment Grandma tied her flour-dusted apron strings to the laughter that filled her cozy kitchen, baking has always been at the heart of our cherished traditions.</p>
                <br>
                    <h4>Sunday Baking Days</h4>
                    <p>Every Sunday, the whole family would gather around Grandma's kitchen table, ready to mix, knead, and taste-test. It was more than just baking; it was a time to reconnect, tell stories, and share laughter. The smell of freshly baked bread and cookies became a symbol of home.</p>         
                <br>
                    <h4>Holiday Baking Marathons</h4> 
                    <p>Christmas, Thanksgiving, and even Easter were incomplete without Grandma's baking marathons. She'd wake up before dawn, rolling out pie crusts and frosting cookies. We kids were her “taste testers,” sneaking bites and decorating treats (though most frosting ended up on our faces).</p>             
                <br>
                    <h4>Passing Down Recipes</h4> 
                    <p>One of Grandma's favorite traditions was teaching us her recipes. She believed the kitchen was the perfect classroom. From learning to measure ingredients to kneading dough just right, every moment was a lesson in love and patience.</p>         
                <br>
                    <p>These traditions are more than just rituals—they're our way of preserving Grandma's legacy and the love she poured into every bite. Now, through this website, we hope to share a little of that magic with you.</p>

                <p>Welcome to a world of warmth, where every recipe has a story and every story starts in Grandma's kitchen. From her first batch of cookies to her signature apple pie, Grandma's love for baking was more than a passion—it was her way of bringing people together.<br>

                    Today, her treasured recipes live on, passed down with her heartfelt wisdom and a sprinkle of nostalgia. Every bite carries the warmth of her apron-clad hugs and the memories of time spent together.<br>
                    
                    This website is a tribute to her legacy, inviting you to bring a little of Grandma's magic into your home. </p>
